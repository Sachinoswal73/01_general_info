        <p>
            - Developer's Console is important for Developers to check the flow / steps / values of result & to debug the code. 
            <br>
            - We can use console.log() to check the values of the declarations / function etc. 
            <br>
            - You can directly write JavaScript code into the console to check the execution of your code.
            <br>
            - To check how a function is working throughout the program, go to Option 'Sources'. --> Then open the js file. --> Click on the line where you want to set the 'Breakpoint' & refresh the Browser. --> There you can check the values of the arguement step by step. or You can set the Breakpoint to the next line etc.
            <br>
            <b>Ex.</b> Check Console : line no. 7
            <br>
            - In console.log() | console is a object ( closest parent object of log() ) where log() is a method inside object console 
            <br>
            - In document.write() | document is a object ( closest parent object of write() ) where write() is a method inside object document 
            <br>

        <p>
            - JavaSript is an Object Oriented Language which runs on Clien-Side in a browser ( Every browser has it's own JavaScript Engine). It makes a website / a web-application interactive & dynamic. Because of Javascript, Web-application responds to the user's events quickly on the basis of the input provided by the users.
            <br>
            - JavaScript is loosely typed language
            <br>
            - Primitive Datatypes - ( String - 'abc' | Number - 9,1,0.5 etc | Boolean - true & false | Undefined - property which not declared | Null - property is declared but no value is assigned yet )
            <br>
            - Non-Primitive Datatypes - ( Object - { name : 'abc', age : 9, indian : true, child : ['xyz', 73, 'dghj'], score : 0.7 } | Array - ['jfk', 90, true] 
            <br>
            - 'typeof a' is used to check the datatype of any variable you have used in your JavaScript code.
            <br>
            - <b>*</b> To check datatype of variable xs;
            <br>
            - Output --> 
            <script>
                var xs;
                var xs = 34;
                // var xs = 'lgk';
                // var xs = [];
                // var xs = {};
                // var xs = true;
                document.write(typeof xs);
            </script>
